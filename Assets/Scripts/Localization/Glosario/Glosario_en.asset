    m_Localized: Sulfur is a yellow chemical element with a strong odor similar to
      rotten eggs. Although its odor can be unpleasant, sulfur is very useful in
      the production of fireworks, medicines, food and in agriculture to help plants
      grow healthy. In addition, sulfur is essential for life on Earth, as it is
      found in many proteins in our bodies and those of other living things.

    m_Localized: 'Chlorophyll is like "food" for plants. It gives them green color
      and helps them make their own food. Plants use chlorophyll to take sunlight
      and convert it into energy, in a process called photosynthesis.

      It''s
      as if plants have their own solar stove. Chlorophyll is like the main ingredient
      in their recipe for making food, and without it, plants couldn''t survive.
      That''s why it''s so important!'

    m_Localized: 'CO2 is an important gas for plants because it helps them make their
      own food in a process called photosynthesis.

      Plants absorb CO2 from
      the air through tiny holes in their leaves called stomata. Then, along with
      sunlight and water, plants use the CO2 to make glucose, which is like their
      food.

      So CO2 is like a key ingredient in the plants'' food recipe.
      Without it, plants could not survive or grow.'
