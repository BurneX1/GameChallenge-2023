    m_Localized: Sulfur is a yellow chemical element with a strong odor similar to
      rotten eggs. Although its odor can be unpleasant, sulfur is very useful in
      the production of fireworks, medicines, food and in agriculture to help plants
      grow healthy. In addition, sulfur is essential for life on Earth, as it is
      found in many proteins in our bodies and those of other living things.

    m_Localized: 'Chlorophyll is like "food" for plants. It gives them green color
      and helps them make their own food. Plants use chlorophyll to take sunlight
      and convert it into energy, in a process called photosynthesis.

      It''s
      as if plants have their own solar stove. Chlorophyll is like the main ingredient
      in their recipe for making food, and without it, plants couldn''t survive.
      That''s why it''s so important!'

    m_Localized: 'CO2 is an important gas for plants because it helps them make their
      own food in a process called photosynthesis.

      Plants absorb CO2 from
      the air through tiny holes in their leaves called stomata. Then, along with
      sunlight and water, plants use the CO2 to make glucose, which is like their
      food.

      So CO2 is like a key ingredient in the plants'' food recipe. Without
      it, plants could not survive or grow.'

    m_Localized: "Phosphorus is a chemical element found in the earth, in rocks and
      in soil. It is important for life on Earth because it helps plants grow and
      develop.\r\nPlants need phosphorus to produce energy and to grow their roots,
      leaves and fruits. Animals also need phosphorus to keep bones and teeth strong
      and healthy.\r"

    m_Localized: 'Glucose is a type of sugar that is very important in photosynthesis,
      the process plants use to produce their own food.

      During photosynthesis,
      plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
      Glucose is like food for plants; it is their nourishment. Plants store glucose
      in their cells and use it to produce energy for all their activities, such
      as growth and reproduction.'

      atoms and one oxygen atom. It is known as water and is essential for life on
      our planet.

      Water is a liquid substance found in rivers, lakes, oceans
      and also in rain. Water can also be found in other places, such as inside plants
      and animals.'

    m_Localized: Magnesium is an important mineral for our body and is found in many
      foods. It helps keep our bones strong, regulates heart rate and muscle function.
      It is also essential in photosynthesis, as it is part of chlorophyll, the green
      pigment that plants use to produce their own food.
